# Homework 3 AI Synthesis Activity

## Activity B: You did NOT use AI

### Part 1

> Explain some improvement you want to make within your code. Perhaps you have a code block that could be more concise, or a part of your code could be improved with a library or be performed with a more efficient algorithm.

I think I could definetly improve my validatePizzaOrder function, especially with creating more edge case checks to make my function very robust. Additionally, I could also change the way I handle forbidden toppings, as I simply went off the first Zod documentation I saw for that type of check, but if I read more, I could've implemented this using a different function or something easier. 

### Part 2

> Ask AI how to improve your code, by picking a part of your program you are interested in improving and asking something along the lines of "how can I improve this code?" This does not have to be verbatim; you could ask more specific questions for improvement, like "what JavaScript libraries could improve the efficiency of my code?" Screenshot or link the response.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the response the AI generates. You may need to do some research to do this evaluation, to see if the syntax generates correctly or if any libraries the AI suggests are appropriate for the current task. Report on whether the AI's solution fits within your project, or if it would need modifications to work properly.

The response AI gives is helpful, as it provides me ways to make my code more robust, especially in terms of providing better error messages to pinpoint exactly what errors I am facing when validating certain json files. Additionally, I am told to set a default for all the attributes of my schema, which I thought about implementing, but then reread the project requirements and saw that it told us exactly which parts to set to optional. Furthermore, it discussed size validation, where we make sure the number we are entering is actually an integer. This can be reflected in other fields, but is not part of the requirements, so it doesn't need to be implemented. However, I don't need to use any of the AI suggestions as my code is robust and works well in the context of my project.
